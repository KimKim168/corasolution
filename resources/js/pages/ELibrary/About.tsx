                        <p>
                            Under the careful leadership of the university's leadership and management, the library of the Royal University of Law and
                            Economics has developed rapidly with the implementation of modern software to manage the library's operations. As a
                            result, the library initially used a world-class library management system called Koha , which made library management
                            easier with book search, book data storage, loan management, and many other important functions. At the same time, the
                            library has also prepared an E-Library project , through which students and professors can easily use the library of the
                            Royal University of Law and Economics via the Internet.
